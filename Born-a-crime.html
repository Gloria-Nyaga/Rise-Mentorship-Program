        <p>Trevor, the book's protagonist, the son of Patricia, a South African woman who is present in his life throughout the chapters. We </p>
        <p>learn about love, religion, apartheid, humor, and family.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Noah discusses the church and his mother's devotion to religion. They attended the mixed-racial church was jubilant, the all-white</p>
        <p> church was analytical and centered on a thorough study of the scriptures and the last one was for all blacks.</p> 
        <p>Trevor had a narrow escape from death. His mother once flung him from a moving minibus and then jumped herself. His mother explains </p>
        <p>it was for their safety. She later praised God for saving both of them.</p> 
        <br>

        <p>The second chapter delves into South Africa's history, namely how colonization and apartheid were built on tribal and racial differe</p>
        <p>nces. Trevor was  born in 1984 to a white father and black mother which was against the law. Hence he refers to being born a crime.</p>
        <p> To avoid being taken by the police, his grandmother forced him to play indoors.</p>
        <p>Patricia is fearless. She ran away from home to live and work in Johannesburg which was illegal for black people to live within city</p>
        <p>limits. She had sexual relations with a white man which was against the law at the time. </p>
        <br>

        <p>Growing up I spent the most time with my relatives. I felt I never belonged. Some were welcoming and some never took me in as their own.</p>
        <p>I had no say in that but I would have loved it if they treated me better.</p>
